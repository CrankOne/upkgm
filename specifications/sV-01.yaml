comments:
    brief: >
        The StromaV package is designed as a supporting framework for
        scientific experiments in High Energy Physics of samll and medium
        scale.
    extended: >
        The StromaV provides few software solutions glueing together
        Monte-Carlo provided by Geant4 framework and ROOT data anlysis
        framework while offering a conventions for simplified creation of data
        treatment pipeline based on Google Protobuf messages data structures.

deps:
    # The Goo library is an obligatory dependency. The sV package is
    # completely based on top of it. Here we require Goo of any version
    # being installed.
    - pkg-name: dev-cpp/goo
    # traits: persistent, static, required are set by default.
    # ROOT is an obligatorey dependency. The sV package can not be built
    # without it. We require the ROOT being of 6 or above major versions here:
    - pkg-name: >=sci-phys/root-6
    # The Geant4 is an optional dependency that enables various MC
    # functionality of sV, that can be omitted in case when only analysis
    # routines are needed:
    - pkg-name: >=sci-phys/geant-4
      provides: mc  # causes optional be set by default
      # + persistent, static set by default
    # The SWIG is required only to generate the wrapper code
    - pkg-name: swig
      traits: temporary, optional  # + static, set by default
